# Deep Morphological Networks with Neural Architecture Search
This is a project to study the effect of morphological network on image classification and edge detection based on Neural Architecture Optimization.

There are two sub-projects, one is for image classification which is NAO-V2 and the other is for edge detection which is NAO_Seg_v2:

1. NAO-V2: Official implementation of NAO-V2: [Understanding and Improving One-shot Neural Architecture Optimization]. Thanks to [Neural Architecture Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07233), we proposed a new morphological network which has better performance on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 than traditional convolutional layers.

2. Released with the paper [Richer Convolutional Features for Edge Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02103). The purpose of this project is for edge detection. On the basis of ResNet-101, a decoder is added(where we call the new DNN **NAO-Multi-scale**) in order to get better edge detection effect and prove the superiority of the morphological network. The decoder is based on cells which are generated by NAO-V2.

## Requirements
* Pytorch >= 1.0.0
* Dataset for edge detection(provided by [Richer Convolutional Features for Edge Detection repo](https://github.com/yun-liu/rcf))
  * [http://mftp.mmcheng.net/liuyun/rcf/data/bsds_pascal_train_pair.lst]
  * [http://mftp.mmcheng.net/liuyun/rcf/data/HED-BSDS.tar.gz]
  * [http://mftp.mmcheng.net/liuyun/rcf/data/PASCAL.tar.gz]
* Eval method provided by [hed](https://github.com/xwjabc/hed/tree/c8ed5abc4d2b6ad2862b0d61cf6184ce2cdf3cae/eval), but please replace the file ```eval_edge.m``` where we just modified the path and we keep the same for other parameters for fairness.
* and other requirements... (cv2, numpy , etc.)

## Usage for classification
* To search the CNN architecture with the morphological network, please refer firstly to:
```
bash ./NAO_V2/train_search_cifar10.sh
```
* After model searching, we need to train CIFAR 10, then refer to:

| Dataset       | Script        | Time          | Top1 Error Rate  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
|CIFAR-10       | ./NAO_V2/train_NAONet_V2_36_cifar10.sh | 2 days | **2.63%** | 
```
bash ./NAO_V2/train_NAONet_V2_36_cifar10.sh
```

## Usage for edge detection
### BSD500
* Firstly download the dataset and then use NAO to search the CNN architecture with the morphological gradient network, refer to:
```
bash ./NAO_Seg_v2/train_search_BSD500.sh
```
* After model searching, we need to train BSD500, then refer to:

| Dataset       | Script        | Time          | ODS  | OIS  |AP  |R50  |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | 
|BSD500      | ./NAO_Seg_v2/train_NAOUNet_Berkeley.sh | 2 days | **0.814±0.001** |  **0.831±0.001** | **0.850±0.002** | **0.908±0.005** |
```
bash ./NAO_Seg_v2/train_NAOUNet_Berkeley.sh
```
* After training, we can get test predict features maps by runing:
```
bash ./NAO_Seg_v2/test_NAOUNet_Berkeley.sh
```
