# Neural Architecture Optimization
This is the library of Neural Architecture Optimization

The library currently contains following sub-libraries:
1. NAO-V1: Official pytorch implementation of cnn part of [Neural Architecture Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07233), by [Renqian Luo](http://home.ustc.edu.cn/~lrq)\*, [Fei Tian](https://ustctf.github.io/)\*, [Tao Qin](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/taoqin/), [En-Hong Chen](http://staff.ustc.edu.cn/~cheneh/), [Tie-Yan Liu](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/tyliu/). *=equal contribution
2. NAO-V2: Official implementation of NAO-V2: [Understanding and Improving One-shot Neural Architecture Optimization]

## NAO-Seg V2
Released with the paper [Richer Convolutional Features for Edge Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02103). The purpose of this project is for edge detection.On the basis of ResNet-101, a decoder is added in order to get better edge detection effect and prove the superiority of morphological operation. The decoder is based on cells which are generated by NAO-V2
