# Deep Morphological Networks with Neural Architecture Search
This is a project to study the effect of morphological network on image classification and edge detection based on Neural Architecture Optimization.

There are two sub-projects, one is for image classification which is NAO-V2 and the other is for edge detection which is NAO_Seg_v2:

1. NAO-V2: Official implementation of NAO-V2: [Understanding and Improving One-shot Neural Architecture Optimization]. Thanks to [Neural Architecture Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.07233), we proposed a new morphological network which has better performance on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 than traditional convolutional layers.

2. Released with the paper [Richer Convolutional Features for Edge Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02103). The purpose of this project is for edge detection. On the basis of ResNet-101, a decoder is added(where we call the new DNN **NAO-Multi-scale**) in order to get better edge detection effect and prove the superiority of the morphological network. The decoder is based on cells which are generated by NAO-V2.

## Requirements
* Pytorch >= 1.0.0
* Dataset for edge detection(provided by [Richer Convolutional Features for Edge Detection repo](https://github.com/yun-liu/rcf))
  * [http://mftp.mmcheng.net/liuyun/rcf/data/bsds_pascal_train_pair.lst]
  * [http://mftp.mmcheng.net/liuyun/rcf/data/HED-BSDS.tar.gz]
  * [http://mftp.mmcheng.net/liuyun/rcf/data/PASCAL.tar.gz]
* Eval method provided by [hed](https://github.com/xwjabc/hed/tree/c8ed5abc4d2b6ad2862b0d61cf6184ce2cdf3cae/eval), but please replace the file ```eval_edge.m``` where we just modified the path and we keep the same for other parameters for fairness.
* and other requirements... (cv2, numpy , etc.)
